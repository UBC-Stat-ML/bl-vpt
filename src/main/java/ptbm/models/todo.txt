/*
 * models we want to test
 * 
 * existing:
 * 
 * - logistic
 * - copy number **
 * - ode **
 * - hierarchical model (rocket, vaccine)
 * - mixture (just doing
 * 
 * easy
 * 
 * - N school
 * - new logistics: sparse, other link functions, large p, large n, large p&n
 * - new ode (from bench paper)
 * - causality
 * - AR, ARIMA, etc
 * - spatial problem
 * - spline
 * - Stochastic volatility models
 * - more regression (G prior, other GLM, etc)
 * 
 * [ *** check out newly found list https://github.com/andrewcparnell/jags_examples/tree/master/R%20Code ]
 * 
 * interesting variational
 * 
 * - Ising with structured variation
 * - spike-and-slab
 * 
 * unknown variational
 * 
 * - tree
 * - mixture
