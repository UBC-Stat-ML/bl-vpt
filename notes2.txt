finish output
	DONE add monitors (Rej and Inef) to the optimization.csv file
	DONE create plot for gradient estimates too
	DONE fix output in stochastic-gradient to add obj facet 
DONE effective step size

-> one or two other models
	DONE uncollapsed [full thing is slow]

setup stoch ?




** start up a campaign - plan for meeting **

	- slightly more robust to NaN

- get in touch with V

- use SNR to automatically determine number of gradient steps?

things to investigate
- random seed (but not init for now)
- SGD different step sizes + vs Adam
- number of chains, number of gradient steps
- different models
- SKL vs Rejection

** schedule discretization learning ? *** use tree structure!

prepare big run ?

how to evaluate ?
	- clouds of stoch optimization
