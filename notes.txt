- is IS working on real models?
	- get nextflow to work - DONE!

- optimization too fragile at the moment
	- how to get initial step size?
	- how to set n steps in gradient?
	- bail out strategy? start super aggressive, then double # MC iters, cut initial step size?

overnight:
- one big one with IS
- one big one without IS

- initial step size 
loop:
1. crude variance estimate
2. line search based on naive CIs


idea:
- start very high
- monitor E[delta]; or *pr(improvement)* => if not a martingale; decrease step size by factor 2

- alternate between 
	- 1 - 10x more costly move to
		- monitor progress
		- set step size


===

- clean up and typeset IS experiments
  - add results for the hierarchical model
  
- basic optimization results
  - random restarts

- rerun PT at the end
- plot variational distribution




- models:
  - GLM
  - Spike and slabs
  - copy number inference
  - elliptic curve
  - Ising + magnetic field 
  
+ new models
  - causality
  - vaccine
  - 8 schools
  - neal's funnel
