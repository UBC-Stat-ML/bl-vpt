- our scheme (adaptive conveyor belt) 
- MMV (rev)
- 1 chain
- ARR (rev)
- DOE (fixed chain)


- models:
	- unidentif
	- mixture - MVN version?
	- challenger?
	- change point - find more serious one?

	- hierarchical/rocket  <-- yes, do it for a selected subset


	- spike and slab <-- yes!
	- diffusion?
	- deconvolution with human SNPs? - might need random pair object - better: IntVar and RealVar impls with constraints (might need to think about how and if to allow the constraints to be random - still use slicer but started at full domain - after that might want to change the default window for integer slicer - need more diagnostics for slicers!!!


- for later:
	- classical phylogenetics <-- no, just understood that intermediate distributions not easier!
	unless look at artificial mixture problem? or small number of leaves, large number of sites??? 'in silico mixture' of real data? 

- adapt/sampling/combined

- min/quantiles/max
