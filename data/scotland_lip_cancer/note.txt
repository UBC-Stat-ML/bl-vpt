Note: adj.csv is 1 indexed while data.csv is 0-indexed. 
It's on purpose, the current script to read in takes that into account.

Used:

source('data/scotland_lip_cancer.RData')
scaled_x <- c(scale(x))
df <- data.frame(counts = O, expectedCounts = E, covariates = scaled_x)


Then a manually tweak to make it 0-indexed
