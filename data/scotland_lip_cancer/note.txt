Note: adj.csv is 1 indexed while data.csv is 0-indexed. 
It's on purpose, the current script to read in takes that into account.

Used:

source('data/scotland_lip_cancer.RData')  # copied from https://github.com/mbjoseph/CARstan/tree/master/data see also doc at https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/mbjoseph-CARStan.html
scaled_x <- c(scale(x))
df <- data.frame(counts = O, expectedCounts = E, covariates = scaled_x)


Then a manually tweak to make it 0-indexed


Then to put the adj matrix in a separate file (matrix A is loaded by the source command above)

write.csv(A, "adj.csv")
